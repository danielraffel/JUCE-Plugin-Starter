1. Identify Optional Installer Assets

Task: Review the installer packaging process in

sign_and_package_plugin.sh as well as related files like distribution.xml and postinstall .

Goals:

• Detect optional UI/installer components such as:

• Welcome prompts

• Customization options

• Post-install screens or UI logic

• Determine how they are used in the packaging process.

Plan:

• Propose a detection-and-opt-in mode (keep it simple maybe just renaming templates):

• If optional files exist, acknowledge and run them.

• If not, log their absence by finding the example templates included and continue gracefully.

• Preserve modularity and allow “smart discovery.”

2. Analyze and Modularize the Post-Install UV Setup

Task: Examine the postinstall script and its logic around:

• Setting up a Python virtual environment with UV

• Installing dependencies

Goals:

• Design a pattern for optional use, activated only when desired.

Plan:

• Introduce a reusable script (e.g., setup_uv_environment.sh and determine if we need the installer_binaries folder and how to make it easy to populate if we do)

• Leave a stub file (postinstall.example) in the root with guidance to rename it to activate

• Unless you have a better idea include a commented block in postinstall and a message in sign_and_package_plugin.sh that explains how to enable it

• Ensure this is fully optional and does nothing unless activated

⸻

3. Design a Plug-and-Play Architecture

Task: Generalize useful logic from PlunderTube (without project-specific branding) to make JUCE-Plugin-Starter more modular.

Goals:

• Support optional features like:

• Custom installer UI logic to enabe PKG features if files like terms, etc exist

• Postinstall hooks

• Dependency installers for UV in a virtual environment

• Maintain template cleanliness and avoid bloat

Plan:

• Rely only on generic filenames and ENV variables

• Auto-detect optional scripts and integrate only if present

• Ensure full backward compatibility with minimal required config

⸻

4. Evaluate .env and CMakeLists.txt Adjustments in PlunderTube

Task: Review whether updates to .env.example or CMakeLists.txt in JUCE-Plugin-Starer would be needed to support modular behavior.

Plan:

• Propose minimal additions only

• Document all changes clearly and ensure they’re opt-in

• Preserve portability and usability across use cases

⸻

5. Update the README.md (Distribution Section Only)

Task: Review the distribution section of the JUCE-Plugin-Starter README and insert explanations of the new capabilities.

Goals:

• Document proposed modular behaviors without labeling them as “new”

• Avoid rewriting the full README

Plan:

• Update where appropriate to describe:

• Optional installer asset inclusion

• UV setup scripting and explain the value of a virtual environment when distributing packages like specific python dependencies and additional libraries

• Add support to sign_and_package_plugin.sh to Zip PKG and uninstaller logic like sign_and_package_plugin.sh

⸻

6. Add Optional Uninstaller Script Support

Task: Propose a pattern for developers to include an uninstaller script (uninstall_plugin.sh) in the .dmg.

Plan:

• Use a standard location such as installer/uninstall_plugin.sh

• In sign_and_package_plugin.sh, check for its presence and add it to the .dmg if available and keep it up-to-date

⸻

7. Support Zipping the DMG During Packaging

Task: Mirror PlunderTube’s behavior by ensuring the .dmg is zipped after creation.

Plan:

• Add zip logic to sign_and_package_plugin.sh, behind an optional flag or automatic default

• Ensure the zipped .dmg is easy to find and use in CI or manual distribution

⸻

8. Prepare for Milestone-Based Implementation

Once we agree on the plan, implementation will proceed in phased milestones to keep progress manageable and reviewable.

Example Milestones:

1. Installer asset detection + modular packaging

2. Postinstall + UV setup opt-in structure

3. Config file updates (.env, CMakeLists.txt)

4. README revisions

5. Uninstaller + zipped DMG support

6. Script refactors and developer UX polish

⸻

9. Xcode Auto-Open Toggle + Doc Update

Task: In generate_and_open_xcode.sh, comment out the auto-opening of the Xcode project:

# # Open the generated Xcode project

# if [ -d "$XCODE_PROJECT" ]; then

#   open "$XCODE_PROJECT"

# else

#   echo "Xcode project not found: $XCODE_PROJECT"

#   exit 1

# fi

Plan:

• Leave this block commented by default

• In the README’s AI Tools → Alex Sidebar section, mention:

• This behavior is optional

• Recommended for users not using Cursor or who want to immediately launch Xcode after regeneration

• Safe to leave disabled if working in alternative editors

⸻

10. Refactor Scripts to a /scripts Directory

Task: Propose moving utility scripts to a consistent folder and clean up calls throughout the project.

Plan:

• Move the following (with naming cleanup if needed):

• generate_and_open_xcode.sh → scripts/

• init_plugin_project.sh → scripts/

• dependencies.sh → scripts/

• Audit all references to these scripts and update paths as necessary (codebase-wide)

• Ensure this change is thoroughly tested

⸻

11. Add Cursor Rules for AI Behavior

Task: Create a .cursor/rules/plugin_starter.mdc file that helps AI tools (like Cursor or Alex Sidebar) follow best practices.

Plan:

• Rule example: “Always place test scripts in scripts/tests/ when generating or suggesting CLI tooling.”

• Include guidance for code structure, naming conventions, and optional file handling

• Make it helpful, not restrictive — the goal is to assist contributors using AI tools
